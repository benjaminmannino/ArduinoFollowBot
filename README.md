# ArduinoFollowBot
# Object Following Robot (Arduino + Ultrasonic Sensor)

## Overview
This project uses an Arduino, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and an L298N motor driver to create a two-wheel robot that follows an object at a set distance.

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- L298N motor driver
- 2x DC motors
- 12V power supply
- Red LED

## Features
- Language: C++ (Arduino)
- Control loop controls LED to signal when object is out of range.
- Object detection with an ultrasonic sensor.
